# Data Science Repository

This repository contains data science projects I worked for self learning and hobby purposes. These projects are written in Python (Jupyter Notebook). The goal of the projects is to apply machine learning model and visualization technique to find something that is interesting. A typical project consists of data cleaning, data visualization and analysis, and applying machine learning.
